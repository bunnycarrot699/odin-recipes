          <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Make the chicken: Combine yogurt, garam masala, paprika, black pepper, salt, cayenne pepper, and coriander in a large bowl. Add chicken strips and toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and place onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each piece.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and set aside.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and cook, sirring gently, until lightly toasted and aromatic, about 3 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until onion begins to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Add chile peppers, garlic, and ginger; continue to cook and stir until onion is browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, and water; cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes begin to break down, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add garam masala, coriander, turmeric, and salt, then stir in chicken and cream until well combined; cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.</li>
          </ol>
